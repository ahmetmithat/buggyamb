The problem scenarios are in "Problem Pages". If you click Problem Pages link you will see the following screen:

The <code>content area</code> is where you see the results when you click a link.

Links for the problem scenarios are located on the left pane along with a link to the "working" scenario and a link to an experimental "load generator" page.

<code>Expected Results</code>, as its name suggests, is the page which is working fine. You can use this page to compare the <code>Slow</code> scenario. See it is in action in the screenshot below, when you click the <code>Slow</code> link the page should load in seconds:

<code>Slow</code> scenario is where things start to go wrong. When you click the link you should see that loading the same content takes much more than the fast one:

Things go weirder if you run the <code>Slow 2</code> scenario and the page keeps loading and never finishes:
